# Auto Frame Range
- Range Engine 1.2a (Blender 2.79.7)

## What is this?
This Add-on does the same thing as the original one, but now compatible with Blender 2.79. In addition to compatibility, I also reworked the code.

## How to install?
- Copy the "FR_Auto_Frame_Range_279" folder to your Blender add-ons folder (Usually '2.79\scripts\addons')
- Open Blender, go to "File > User Preferences > Add-ons > and, in "Categories", select "Utility" and check "Utility: Frame Ranger Lite".

A button will immediately appear at the end of the header of the "Timeline", "Dope Sheet", "Graph Editor", "NLA Editor" and "Video Sequencer" area, with the difference of "Dope Sheet" which will appear plus one that shows the addon settings panel
